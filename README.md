# Create Events Activity

Activity for creating events. 

## Purpose

This is created just for practice; I just got a random freebie design from dibbble. You can check Brice SÃ©raphin awesome desings at: https://dribbble.com/briceseraphin

### What you can find in this project

This is a simple UI, with no functionality, just for practicing design in XML with Android Studio, to become more agile at it. I used the following libraries and assets:

* CardView and RecyclerView for implement the category and ticket Views (with clickListener)
* Ubuntu font
* Some drawables to style buttons
  
I kwow it's just a messy XML, hard to read.. but I'll try to refactor all that XML into the styles.xml file to clean it a little.
